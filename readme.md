# Off The Rails: Web Apps With Rack, Sinatra, Grape, and Siesta

This is a talk and related code written by Alex Chaffee about Rack apps and Ruby webapp frameworks that are *not* on Rails. It lives at <https://github.com/alexch/off-the-rails>

`off-the-rails.md` is the markdown document of the "slides" (more like notes) for the presentation.

`app.rb` is a little Rack app that renders the slides into HTML and wraps them in a page with some CSS. Run it with `ruby app.rb`

`rack/` and `sinatra/` contain sample apps that are referenced by the talk.
